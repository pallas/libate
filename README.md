libate
======

libate is a simple wrapper around clock_gettime.  It was created so that the
author could do simple performance testing.  It is not meant as a
replacement for other, similar frameworks.

It includes the following utility programs

 * ticktock --- take a series of sleep times, ping after each expires

In the future, the intention is to add a real library.
